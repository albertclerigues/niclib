# niclib 1.0b0

niclib is a utility library to ease the development of neuroimaging pipelines using deep learning.
This library attempts to offers a simple interface to commonly used functions and procedures when dealing with
file storage, data operations, data and patch generators, network training, loss functions and evaluation metrics.

This library does't aim to be a complete deep learning framework or serve as full replacement of other deep learning
or neuroimaging libraries.
If more advanced functionality is required, we encourage the user to use the provided code as a starting point to
implement their own needs.

## Installation
